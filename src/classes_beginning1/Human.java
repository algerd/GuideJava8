    final keyword:

        - A method declaration: If a method is declared final, it cannot be redefined (overridden or hidden) in the subclasses of the class that contains the method.    
    
    There are two ways to initialize a final variable:
        - You can initialize it at the time of its declaration.
        - You can defer its initialization until a later time.
    You must initialize the final variable before it is read for the first time.
    Blank final object variables must be initialized in one of the instance initializers or all !!! constructors. 
    If you change the value of the compile-time constant in the class, you must recompile all the classes that refer to the constant. Otherwise,
    they will continue using the old value of constant that existed when they were compiled last time.
